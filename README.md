# Google Maps Place Picker

A Flutter plugin which provides 'Picking Place' using [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) widget.

The project relies on below packages.

Map using Flutter's official [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)   
Fetching current location using Baseflow's [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator)   
Place and Geocoding API using hadrienlejard's [google_maps_webservice](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_webservice)   
Builder using kevmoo's [tuple](https://pub.dev/packages/tuple)

## Getting Started

* Get an API key at <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>.

* Enable Google Map SDK for each platform.
  * Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  * Choose the project that you want to enable Google Maps on.
  * Select the navigation menu and then select "Google Maps".
  * Select "APIs" under the Google Maps menu.
  * To enable Google Maps for Android, select "Maps SDK for Android" in the "Additional APIs" section, then select "ENABLE".
  * To enable Google Maps for iOS, select "Maps SDK for iOS" in the "Additional APIs" section, then select "ENABLE".
  * Make sure the APIs you enabled are under the "Enabled APIs" section.

* You can also find detailed steps to get started with Google Maps Platform [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started).

### Android

Specify your API key in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
```

> **NOTE:** As of version 3.0.0 the geolocator plugin switched to the AndroidX version of the Android Support Libraries. This means you need to make sure your Android project is also upgraded to support AndroidX. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/androidx-compatibility). 
>
>The TL;DR version is:
>
>1. Add the following to your "gradle.properties" file:
>
>```
>android.useAndroidX=true
>android.enableJetifier=true
>```
>2. Make sure you set the `compileSdkVersion` in your "android/app/build.gradle" file to 28:
>
>```
>android {
>  compileSdkVersion 28
>
>  ...
>}
>```
>3. Make sure you replace all the `android.` dependencies to their AndroidX counterparts (a full list can be found here: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate).

### iOS

Specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m`:

```objectivec
#include "AppDelegate.h"
#include "GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h"
#import "GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR KEY HERE"];
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}
@end
```

Or in your swift code, specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import GoogleMaps

@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR KEY HERE")
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
}
```

On iOS you'll need to add the following entries to your Info.plist file (located under ios/Runner) in order to access the device's location. 

Simply open your Info.plist file and add the following:

``` xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when open.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when in the background.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs access to location when open and in the background.</string>
```

In addition, you need to add the `Background Modes` capability to your XCode project (Project > Signing and Capabilties > "+ Capability" button) and select `Location Updates`.g>This app needs access to location when open and in the background.</string>

Opt-in to the embedded views preview by adding a boolean property to the app's `Info.plist` file
with the key `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` and the value `YES`.

```xml
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
```
## Usage

### Basic usage

You can use PlacePicker by pushing to a new page using Navigator, OR put as a child of any widget.  
When the user picks a place on the map, it will return result to 'onPlacePicked' with PickResult type.
Alternatively, you can build your own way with 'selectedPlaceWidgetBuilder' and fetch result from it (See the instruction below).

```dart
Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => PlacePicker(
          apiKey: APIKeys.apiKey,   // Put YOUR OWN KEY here.
          onPlacePicked: (result) { 
            print(result.address); 
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
          initialPosition: HomePage.kInitialPosition,
          useCurrentLocation: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
```

### Customizing picked place visualisation

By default, when a user picks a place by using auto complete search or dragging the map, we display the information at the bottom of the screen (FloatingCard).  

However, if you don't like this UI/UX, simply override the builder using 'selectedPlaceWidgetBuilder'. FlocatingCard widget can be reused which is floating around the screen or build an entirely new widget as you want. It is stacked with the map, so you might want to use the [Positioned](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html) widget.

**Note that using this customization WILL NOT INVOKE [onPlacePicked] callback as it will override default 'Select here' button on floating card**

```dart
...
PlacePicker(apiKey: APIKeys.apiKey,
            ...
            selectedPlaceWidgetBuilder: (_, selectedPlace, state, isSearchBarFocused) {
              return isSearchBarFocused
                  ? Container()
                  // Use FloatingCard or just create your own Widget.
                  : FloatingCard(
                      bottomPosition: 0.0,    // MediaQuery.of(context) will cause rebuild. See MediaQuery document for the information.
                      leftPosition: 0.0,
                      rightPosition: 0.0,
                      width: 500,
                      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12.0),
                      child: state == SearchingState.Searching ? 
                                      Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()) : 
                                      RaisedButton(onPressed: () { print("do something with [selectedPlace] data"); },),
                   );
            },
            ...
          ),
...
```
Parameters | Type | Description
---------- | ---- | -----------
context | BuildContext | Flutter's build context value
selectedPlace | PickResult | Result data of user selected place
state | SearchingState | State of searching action. (Idle, Searching)
isSearchBarFocused | bool | Whether the search bar is currently focused so the keyboard is shown

### Customizing Pin
By default, Pin icon is provided with very simple picking animation when moving around.   
However, you can also create your own pin widget using 'pinBuilder'

```dart
PlacePicker(apiKey: APIKeys.apiKey,
            ...
            pinBuilder: (context, state) {
                  if (state == PinState.Idle) {
                    return Icon(Icons.favorite_border);
                  } else {
                    return AnimatedIcon(.....);
                  }
                },
            ...                        
          ),
...
```

Parameters | Type | Description
---------- | ---- | -----------
context | BuildContext | Flutter's build context value
state | PinState | State of pin. (Preparing; When map loading, Idle, Dragging)

### Changing Colours of default FloatingCard
While you can build your own prediction tile, you still can change the style of default tile using themeData as below:

```dart
// Light Theme
final ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData.light().copyWith(
  // Background color of the FloatingCard
  cardColor: Colors.white,
  buttonTheme: ButtonThemeData(
    // Select here's button color
    buttonColor: Colors.black,
    textTheme: ButtonTextTheme.primary,
  ),
);

// Dark Theme
final ThemeData darkTheme = ThemeData.dark().copyWith(
  // Background color of the FloatingCard
  cardColor: Colors.grey,
  buttonTheme: ButtonThemeData(
    // Select here's button color
    buttonColor: Colors.yellow,
    textTheme: ButtonTextTheme.primary,
  ),
);
```
